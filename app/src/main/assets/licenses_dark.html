        <p>

            Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
            of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>

        <p>This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
            the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
            License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.</p>

        <b><a name="section0" id="section0"></a>0. Additional Definitions.</b>

        <p>As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
            General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU
            General Public License.</p>

        <p>“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License,
            other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.</p>

        <p>An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided
            by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
            Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
            of using an interface provided by the Library.</p>

        <p>A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an
            Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library
            with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked
            Version”.</p>

        <p>The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the
            Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
            for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
            based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.</p>

        <p>The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the
            object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
            and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
            Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.</p>

        <b><a name="section1" id="section1"></a>1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.</b>

        <p>You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
            without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.</p>

        <p>If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
            facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
            that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
            facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
            version:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
                ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
                function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
                whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
            </li>

            Header Files.</b>

        <p>The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
            a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object
            code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
            material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
            layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
            (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
                Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
                covered by this License.
            </li>

            <li>b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
                document.

        <p>You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
            taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
            portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
            engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
            the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
                the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
                covered by this License.
            </li>

            <li>b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
                document.
            </li>

            <li>c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
                execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
                these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
                copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
            </li>

            <li>d) Do one of the following:

                <ul>
                    <li>0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
                        License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
                        suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
                        recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
                        the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
                        manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
                        Corresponding Source.
                    </li>

                    <li>1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
                        Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
                        a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
                        system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
                        of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
                        Version.
                    </li>

                </ul>
            </li>

                be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
                GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
                necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
                Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
                Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
                you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
                the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
                Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
                Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
                for conveying Corresponding Source.)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <b><a name="section5" id="section5"></a>5. Combined Libraries.</b>

        <p>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
            Library side by side in a single library together with other library
            facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
            License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
            choice, if you do both of the following:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
                on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
                conveyed under the terms of this License.
            </li>

            <li>b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
                is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
                accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
            </li>

        </ul>
        <b><a name="section6" id="section6"></a>6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public
            License.</b>

        <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
            of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
            versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
            differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>

        <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
            Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
            of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version”
            applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
            conditions either of that published version or of any later version
            published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
            received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
            General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
            General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>

        <p>If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
            whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
            apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
            permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
            Library.</p>
